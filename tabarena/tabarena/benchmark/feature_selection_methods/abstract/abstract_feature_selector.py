            The maximum number of features to select.
            If int, we assume a fixed number of features to select.
            If float, we assume a fraction of features to select (0 < max_features < 1).
                We always round up.
            If callable, it receives the total number of input features as its single argument
                and must return the desired feature count as an int. Resolved at fit time.

            Configuration of the proxy model to use inside the feature selection method.
        raise_on_useless_feature_selection:

        encoding_permutation_seed:
            Ordinal-encoding ablation. If None (default), categorical columns are ordinal-encoded
            in the usual sorted category order. If set to an int, the category -> integer mapping
            of every ordinal-encoded column is randomly permuted with a dedicated RNG seeded by this
            value. This RNG is independent of ``self.random_state`` (which seeds the random fallback
            and internal train/val splits), so variance across seeds isolates the effect of the
